# datfile-analyzer

As a part of a job offering's selective process, I had to develop a small PHP application to parse `.dat` files which contained data in an specific format and output a result of the analysis.

I had a 48h timebox for that, and was limited to PHP. I could have used libraries or whatever, but I choose to do it vanilla style so I could challenge myself. I ended up with a kind of script that would run and - hopefully - not go down because of random exceptions or unexpected data formats (hey, you do your best with what you have, including time, right!? :D).

The complete statement of work that was sent to me, as well as the evaluation criteria, is available at the [STATEMENT.md](/STATEMENT.md) file.

### How-To

Just run the following:
```
php index.php
```
